Typhoon is a zk-SNARK coin mixer protocol crafted during the buidlbox Starknet Winter Hackathon for Starknet, Typhoon is based on the Tornado Cash protocol, with some changes in the AP (Anonymity Points) reward system, Deposit mechanism, and a Telegram Relayers system (under development). These modifications will be detailed in the subsequent sections of this README.
