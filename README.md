# Typhoon

Typhoon is a zk-SNARK coin mixer protocol crafted during the buidlbox Starknet Winter Hackathon for Starknet, Typhoon is based on the Tornado Cash protocol, with some changes in the AP (Anonymity Points) reward system, Deposit mechanism, and a Telegram Relayers system (under development). These modifications will be detailed in the subsequent sections of this README.

## Who can benefit from Typhoon

As any coin mixer Typhoon aims to enhance privacy for cryptocurrency transactions by obscuring the trail between the funds and their original source. Here are the groups or individuals who might benefit from using Typhoon:

1. Privacy Advocates
    * Individuals who value their financial privacy might use coin mixers to keep their transactions anonymous. They might not want their financial dealings to be traceable, especially in regions where personal financial privacy is not well-protected by law.


2. Cryptocurrency Traders and Investors
    * Some traders might use Typhoon to protect their trading strategies or to keep their portfolio sizes confidential. This can be particularly relevant when dealing with large volumes where revealing transaction patterns could affect market dynamics.


3. Sensitive Businesses Transactions
    * Companies in sectors like journalism, legal services, or any businesses handling sensitive or confidential transactions might use Typhoon to protect the privacy of their clients or their own operations from competitive analysis or unwanted attention.


4. Whistleblowers or Activists
    * Those involved in political activism, whistleblowing, or similar activities might use Typhoon to protect their identities from being traced through financial transactions, especially in oppressive regimes or high-surveillance environments.


5. High Net Worth Individuals
    * Wealthy individuals might employ Typhoon to maintain privacy regarding their wealth or to protect against potential security threats like kidnapping or extortion by keeping their financial movements obscured.
